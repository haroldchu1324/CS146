3. Time complexity for Insertion Sort
Insertion sort starts from the 2nd element and compare it with elements before it. As it is doing that, it
moves the larger elements one position to the right. It then inserts the current element into the correct
position in the sorted array. The time complexity best case is O(n). Worst case is O(n^2). Average case is
O(n^2). Space complexity is O(1).


4. Time complexity for matrix multiplication pseudocode
The code iterates through each element of the matrix result. For each element it computes the sum of products
of elements. The overall time complexity is O(rowsA*colA*colB). The space complexity is O(rowsA*colB).
